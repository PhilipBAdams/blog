### Bio
I am a student at [UChicago](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/) studying Math and Computer Science. I'm primarily interested in systems problems, in particular Vector Search/ANN Search.

I'm also interested in aviation, photography, functional programming, and backpacking. I may touch on some of these topics on this blog, and you can see some of my photos [here](/photos).

### Contact
You can reach me at
`blog (at) [this domain]`.

I read many people's blogs, but am always too shy to email them with questions that I have. If you're like me, please consider this an open invitation to reach out. I'd love to hear from you!
