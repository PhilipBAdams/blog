The product quantization (PQ) support I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on in the SPTAG project has been open-sourced.
SPTAG is an ANN search algorithm that leverages a combination of a space partitioning tree (usually, a balanced k-means tree or k-d tree) and graph (usually, a relative neighborhood graph or KNN graph) to try and provide a good balance between high recall, reasonable index build times, and throughput.</description></item></channel></rss>
