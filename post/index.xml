The product quantization (PQ) support I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on in the SPTAG project has been open-sourced.
SPTAG is an ANN search algorithm that leverages a combination of a space partitioning tree (usually, a balanced k-means tree or k-d tree) and graph (usually, a relative neighborhood graph or KNN graph) to try and provide a good balance between high recall, reasonable index build times, and throughput.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical PQ for ANN Search</title><link>https://pbada.ms/p/multi-pq/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pbada.ms/p/multi-pq/</guid><description>Background Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) Search is a simple problem: given a vector query vector $q$, a set of database vectors $V$, and a metric $d$, find the $v\in V$ that minimize $d(q, v)$. The approximate part of this problem is that an algorithm is allowed to be wrong, and so in particular doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to test every $v\in V$, allowing for significant improvements in performance through the use of various search structures and compression techniques.</description></item></channel></rss>
